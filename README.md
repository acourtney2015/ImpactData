Here I am using data from the World Bank. The primary World Bank collection of development indicators, compiled from officially-recognized international sources. It presents the most current and accurate global development data available, and includes national, regional and global estimates. The topics covered are: Agriculture & Rural Development, Aid Effectiveness, Climate Change, Economy & Growth, Education, Energy & Mining, Environment, External Debt, Financial Sector, Gender, Health, Infrastructure, Labor & Social Protection, Poverty, Private Sector, Public Sector, Science & Technology, Social Development, Trade, Urban Development. From the economies of the countries of WLD, EAP, ECA, LAC, MNA, SAS, SSA, HIC, LMY, IBRD, IDA gathered from 1960 - 2015, a time series covering 217 economies

I built a basic Machine Learning Random Forest Classifier Algorithm that can be used to input a csv data set and predict the result of your choosing. The algorithm will also choose the best predictors to use from within the data set to predict your catagory choice! It is all built so it is turnkey using an Ipython notebook which can be modified and notation of your modification made with the notebook to let others know what you changed and why (while still keeping the original algorithm choices. The notebook contains documentation that makes it easy for anyone (even those who don't know machine learning or algorithms) to use!

Here is a snap shot of what the data looks like over just 3 years for 1 country -here I used Afganistan as an example-. To visual some of the great data info available from the dataset
